    question: 'How does SUBIT.AI work?',
    answer: 'SUBIT.AI uses advanced AI technology (OpenAI Whisper) to automatically transcribe your videos into accurate subtitles. Simply upload your video, our AI processes it, and you get professional subtitles that you can customize and export.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What video formats do you support?',
    answer: 'We support all major video formats including MP4, MOV, AVI, WebM, and MKV. The maximum file size depends on your subscription plan: Free (200MB), Pro (500MB), and Premium (1GB).'
  },
  {
    question: 'How accurate are the AI-generated subtitles?',
    answer: 'Our AI achieves over 95% accuracy for clear audio with good pronunciation. The accuracy may vary based on audio quality, accents, background noise, and technical terminology. You can always edit the subtitles manually.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I customize the subtitle appearance?',
    answer: 'Yes! You can customize fonts, colors, sizes, positioning, and add effects like shadows and animations. Pro and Premium users get access to advanced customization options including custom font uploads.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What languages do you support?',
    answer: 'We support over 50 languages including English, Spanish, French, German, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and many more. The AI automatically detects the language, but you can also specify it manually.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How long does subtitle generation take?',
    answer: 'Processing time varies based on video length and complexity. On average, a 5-minute video takes about 1-2 minutes to process. Longer videos may take proportionally longer.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I download subtitles as SRT files?',
    answer: 'Yes! You can download your subtitles as SRT files for use in other video editing software, or export your video with burned-in subtitles directly from our platform.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Is my video data secure and private?',
    answer: 'Absolutely. We use enterprise-grade security measures to protect your data. Videos are processed securely and can be deleted at any time. We never share your content with third parties.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What is the energy system?',
    answer: 'Energy is our platform\'s currency for AI processing. Different operations consume different amounts of energy. Free users get 30 energy daily, Pro users get 300, and Premium users get unlimited energy.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I cancel my subscription anytime?',
    answer: 'Yes, you can cancel your subscription at any time. You\'ll continue to have access to your plan\'s features until the end of your current billing period.'
